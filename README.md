# Pandas-intro-using-dataframes

In this repo I imported a dataset on a series of cars with
several different attributes, as well as a dataset on avocadoes.
I performed data wrangling on both of these datsets, including filtering 
data, creating new columns, and looking at summary statistics. I
also plotted the data using subplots.
